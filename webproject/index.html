    <p>The original Xbox launched late in 2001, nearly nineteen years ago. A lot has changed with the brand since then, bringing more
    power, more exclusives, and more value to consumers around the world. Now, the brand is set to reimagine
    itself yet again when the Xbox Series X releases this holiday season. But before we move forward, why not take a look back at what brought us here in the
           first place? Xbox has a storied history — what started out as a simple project has evolved into one of the
           most profitable gaming brands in the entire industry — and it might help us figure out what we can expect from the company moving 
           forward.</p>

      <h2>The early years</h2> 
      
      <p>The notion that Microsoft should develop its own gaming console began gaining traction way back in 1998, with Kevin Bachus, Seamus Blackley, Otto Berkes, and Ted Hase forming the software giant’s first 
      console team after successfully pitching their idea to Bill Gates. 
      Originally dubbed the DirectX Box, the console was intended to be the first game system built like a PC, bringing all of the flexibility and power of a gaming rig to the console market.</p>

      

     <p>The system would run on Windows 2000, making it easy for traditional PC software developers to work within 
     the console’s architecture, and feature more than twice the processing power of the industry-leading PlayStation 2. Despite the marketing 
     team’s belief that the abbreviated “Xbox” name wouldn’t fly, the label went over well with focus groups, providing the company with one of the final 
     elements it needed to pull back the curtain on its creation: A catchy name.</p>
     
     <p>Just two years later, Microsoft was ready to go public with its console, and that’s exactly what Bill Gates did at the Game Developers Conference in 2000. Teasing the system’s vastly improved specs and the potential for both online play and internal storage of downloaded content — games and media – Gates managed to get the world’s attention. Many still 
     remained skeptical of what they saw, seeing nothing more than a fancy PC dressed up as a gaming console.</p>
     
     
     
     <p>Microsoft continued to push the envelope on both the console and its marketing budget with more demonstrations at the Electronic Entertainment Expo a few months later. It was there that the Xbox developer first connected with Bungie Studios, the creators of a third-person shooter Halo: Combat Evolved.
     Microsoft’s $30 million purchase of Bungie a short time later made headlines in the game industry, but it was Bungie’s decision to adapt Halo
     to make the best use of the new console’s abilities and turn it into a first-person shooter. This was the move that helped make history.</p>
     
     <p>Nearly a full year later, Bill Gates, with help from Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, 
     
    revealed the final design of the Xbox at the 2001 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, along with the system’s official release date.</p>
     
     <h2>The big day arrives<h2>
     
     <p>On November 14, the Times Square branch of Toys ‘R’ Us played host to the official launch of the Xbox, with Bill Gates dropping by to kick off his company’s grand experiment in gaming. Concerns regarding the system’s look and design,
     as well as the $299 price tag, fell by the wayside with over 1 million Xbox consoles flying off shelves in the next three weeks.</p>

     <br>
     
     <p>One key component to the console’s success was the popularity of its flagship game, Halo, which offered the one-two punch of being both exclusive to the Xbox and one of the first-person shooter genre’s most compelling, groundbreaking titles to hit shelves in years. Sales of Halo shattered all previous records, with more than 1 million copies of the game sold in the first few months of its release.
     It might not seem like much by today’s standards, but hitting the million-units mark back then was unheard of.</p>
     
     
    <br>
    
    <h3>Xbox Live</h3>
    
    <p>Arguably the most important event in the evolution of the Xbox and the growth of Microsoft’s place in
    the gaming industry occurred on the console’s first birthday with the launch of Xbox Live.</p>
     
     <br>
     
     <p>Microsoft’s long-rumored online gaming network had already begun its beta testing phase in August 2002, but the system went public in November with the Xbox Live Starter Kit. Early adopters were treated to a multiplayer gaming experience that was entirely new to the console industry, pitting players against competitors from all around the world in a communal environment. Along with being able to connect with friends (and strangers),
     Xbox Live also made it possible to download new content and take multiplayer interaction to a new level.</p>
     <p>With over 150,000 subscribers in its first week, Xbox Live was an unmitigated success, 
     and the numbers continued to grow exponentially for Microsoft’s online gaming network in the years to follow.</p>
