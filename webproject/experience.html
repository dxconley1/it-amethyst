<h2>The big day arrives<h2>
     
     <p>On November 14, the Times Square branch of Toys ‘R’ Us played host to the official launch of the Xbox, with Bill Gates dropping by to kick off his company’s grand experiment in gaming. Concerns regarding the system’s look and design,
     as well as the $299 price tag, fell by the wayside with over 1 million Xbox consoles flying off shelves in the next three weeks.</p>

     <p>One key component to the console’s success was the popularity of its flagship game, Halo, which offered the one-two punch of being both exclusive to the Xbox and one of the first-person shooter genre’s most compelling, groundbreaking titles to hit shelves in years. Sales of Halo shattered all previous records, with more than 1 million copies of the game sold in the first few months of its release.
     It might not seem like much by today’s standards, but hitting the million-units mark back then was unheard of.</p>
