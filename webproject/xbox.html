 <h1>Online I Xbox</h1>


<p>Arguably the most important event in the evolution of the Xbox and the growth of Microsoft’s place
in the gaming industry occurred on the console’s first birthday with the launch of Xbox Live.

<p>Microsoft’s long-rumored online gaming network had already begun its beta testing phase in August 2002, but the system went public in November with the Xbox Live Starter Kit. Early adopters were treated to a multiplayer gaming experience that was entirely new to the console industry, pitting players against competitors from all around the world in a communal environment. Along with being able to connect with friends (and strangers), Xbox Live also made it possible 
to download new content and take multiplayer interaction to a new level.</p>
